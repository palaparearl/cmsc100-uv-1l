Git + Github

Basic Workflow:

	do some changes to file

	> git add -A # adds all changed files to index
	> git commit -m "message" # commits all files in index

	(working directory is now clean)

Branches
	> git branch # shows us available branches and active branch
	> git checkout <branch name> # switch to branch

	git checkout -b <new branch name>
